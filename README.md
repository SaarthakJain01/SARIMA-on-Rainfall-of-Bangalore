# 🌧️ Rainfall Forecasting in Bangalore
This project focuses on time series analysis and forecasting of rainfall data for Bangalore using several statistical modeling techniques. The goal is to understand historical rainfall patterns and build predictive models to forecast future trends.

# 📂 Project Overview
Rainfall data often exhibits seasonality and trends, making it a suitable candidate for time series analysis. In this project, I applied multiple time series models to analyze and forecast rainfall patterns:

# ✅ Techniques Used:
1. Time Series Decomposition
Used to break down the series into Trend, Seasonality, and Residual components, helping visualize and understand the underlying structure.

2. Exponential Smoothing (ETS)
Captures level, trend, and seasonality components with various smoothing techniques.

3. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
A basic but powerful time series model that captures autocorrelations and trends in the data.

4. SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
Extends ARIMA by explicitly modeling seasonal patterns—especially useful for monsoon rainfall cycles.


# 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python

pandas – Data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn – Visualization

statsmodels – ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing

numpy – Numerical computations

# 📊 Data
The dataset used contains historical rainfall records of Bangalore over multiple years. It includes monthly/seasonal rainfall amounts which are essential for capturing seasonal trends.

# 📈 Forecasting Goals
Identify long-term rainfall trends

Understand seasonality in Bangalore's rainfall patterns
